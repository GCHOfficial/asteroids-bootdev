# Asteroids

This is my second second Boot.dev project, which is a "remake" of the classic Asteroids game using the Python pygame library

A good exercise following the OOP section, making use of all concepts explained (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism), along with a small refresher of vector operations, all while having fun.
